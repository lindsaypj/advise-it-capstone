# Advise-IT

This website is designed to allow Advisors to create plans for students interested in IT programs at Green River College.

## Current Situation
Advisors in Green River's Software Development department meet with current and prospective students to discuss the student's goals. The advisors help students plan the classes they would need to take to meet their goals. The advisors know when classes are typically offered throughout the year, and it changes regularly.

Currently, when advisor's are meeting with their students, they are constructing a document of sorts to store the student's plan and notes from the meeting. This system is lacking for a few reasons. When creating a new plan, the advisors typically enter many of the same items as they do on other plans. Also, after a plan is created, there is no centralized way for both an advisor and student to store and access the document.

## Our Solution
Advise-IT it a tool that streamlines the creation and maintenance of plans. Both students and advisors are able to easily access plans by following a link where they can view and update it. To remain FERPA complient, no student data will be stored on the plan or within the Advise-IT tool. Since the plans are stored on web servers hosted by Green River, they will allways be accesible to both students and advisors (so long as they still have their link).
